**Description**

The Apache Hive (TM) data warehouse software facilitates reading,
writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage
using SQL. Built on top of Apache Hadoop (TM), it provides:

* Tools to enable easy access to data via SQL, thus enabling data
  warehousing tasks such as extract/transform/load (ETL), reporting,
  and data analysis

* A mechanism to impose structure on a variety of data formats

* Access to files stored either directly in Apache HDFS (TM) or in other
  data storage systems such as Apache HBase (TM)

* Query execution using Apache Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Tez
  or Apache Spark frameworks.

This extension allows the user to interact with a Hive server, and perform the tasks listed below. 

**Services**

`getColumns` - For a specified table returns all the columns, useful for creating a DataShape

`getTables`-  Lists all the available tables on Hive server, useful for debugging/verifying connectivity

`getTable`- Returns an entire table from the server (WIP)

`executeUpdate` - Calls the executeUpdate method that allows data insertion into an existing table. Used for storing user search analytics and saved queries.



**Configuration**

*password* - the password if it is configured

*serverName* - the IP address or hostname of the Solr server

*serverPort* - the port that is configured to receive queries on the Solr server

*userName* - the username that will be used together with the password to authenticate, can be blank

*timeout* - after this interval if a response is not received the connection will time out, in miliseconds

*nosassl* - a boolean that indicates that the authentication type is nosassl
